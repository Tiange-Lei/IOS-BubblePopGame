# IOS-BubblePopGame
The game is called BubblePopIn this
game, a number of bubbles are randomly displayed on an iOS device screen. A player pops a
bubble by touching the bubble, and every time they pop a bubble they earn a certain number of
points. Bubbles come in five colours: red, pink, green, blue and black. Each colour corresponds
to a specific number of points and has a specific probability of appearance. All
bubbles appear on the screen briefly. A player needs to pop as many bubbles as possible within a 
certain timeframe (default to 60 seconds) to get high scores. Notethat, if a player pops two or
more bubbles of the same colour consecutively, they earn 1.5 times the points for the additional 
bubbles they pop. Finally, game scores are saved and a high score board is displayed after a game 
run is finished. Figure 1 provides a rough mock up of what the main interface may look like.
